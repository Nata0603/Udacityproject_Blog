          <p><em>For me, Hygge is much more of a lifestyle than a trend. Hygge offers up a cozy and comfortable feel. I love that it always makes me feel as though I am happy and content.</em></p>
          <p><em>Hygge is a brief moment of pause, solace from craziness, the smallest of moments that make a big difference to how we live, feel, and interact.</em></p>

          <h1>What is Hygge?</h1>
          <p>In the last years, I'm sure you've come across a certain word: Hygge. But what does hygge mean? Pronounced "hoo-ga," this Danish concept cannot be translated to one single word but encompasses a feeling of <span>cozy contentment and well-being through enjoying the simple things</span> in life. If you've ever enjoyed reading a book indoors on a rainy Sunday or a cup of hot cocoa on a snow day, you've experienced hygge without even knowing it.</p>
          <h3>The History of Hygge</h3>
          <p>The warm and cozy lifestyle that hygge promotes has been a key part of Danish culture since the early 1800s. This national obsession is credited as one of the reasons why Denmark is always at the top of the list of the world's happiest countries, despite their infamously miserable winters. While hygge is more of a way of life for Danes, it caught on as a lifestyle trend in the UK in 2016 after several books about the topic were published. In 2017, it was America's turn for hygge. It started trending on social media. And now we all know the word!</p>
          <h3>What Does It Mean to Live a Hygge Life?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Candles.</strong> If you ask a Danish person, they're likely to tell you that candles are the most important part of creating a hyggelig atmosphere.</li>
            <li><strong>Fireplaces.</strong> What could be cozier than curling up by the fire for a warm night in? Bonus points if your mantel is decorated for winter.</li>
            <li><strong>Throw blankets.</strong> Whether a chunky knit, weighted blanket, or heated throw, having something soft to wrap around yourself is a must. As are oversized sweaters and thick socks which also make things way more hygge.</li>
            <li><strong>Homemade sweets, comfort food, and hot drinks.</strong>What you eat is also essential to creating those cozy vibes.</li>
          </ul>
